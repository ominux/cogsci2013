Online learning in spiking networks
===================================

This repository contains the Nengo and analysis scripts
used to generate and analyze data for my Cognitive Science 2013
submission titled "Simultaneous unsupervised and supervised learning
of cognitive functions in biologically plausible spiking neural networks".

Due to their large size, the data generated by the networks
is not included in this repository.
Instead, it is available in my figshare account:

* [Experiment 1](http://figshare.com/articles/CogSci2013_Experiment_1_Results/155314)
* [Experiment 2 optimization](http://figshare.com/articles/CogSci2013_Experiment_2_Optimation/155525)
* [Experiment 2](http://figshare.com/articles/CogSci2013_Experiment_2_Results/155606)
* [Experiment 3](http://figshare.com/articles/CogSci2013_Experiment_3_Results/155317)

If these data files are put in the appropriate directories in
`results`, the figures from the paper can be recreated.
