Experiment 2 Optimization
=========================

The results for optimizing Experiment 2 can be generated
by running the `optimize_parmas.py` script
with Python. This requires the
[hyperopt](http://jaberg.github.com/hyperopt/)
package and `mongodb` running.

However, if you don't want to waste those CPU
cycles, you can download the results used
to generate the paper on
[figshare](http://figshare.com/articles/CogSci2013_Experiment_2_Optimation/155525).

Or, to save even more time, just run the `download_results.py`
script with Python (requires `requests`).
