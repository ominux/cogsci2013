Experiment 1
============

The results for Experiment 1 can be generated
by running the `BCM_Testing.py` script
within Nengo. A sample script for doing this
via the command line is provided in
`nengo-cl.sh`:

  ./nengo-cl.sh BCM_Testing.py

will run the experiment.

However, if you don't want to waste those CPU
cycles, you can download the results used
to generate the paper on
[figshare](http://figshare.com/articles/CogSci2013_Experiment_1_Results/155314).
