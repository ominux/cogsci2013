Experiment 3
============

The results for Experiment 3 can be generated
by running the `LearnDigits.py` script
within Nengo. A sample script for doing this
via the command line is provided in
`nengo-cl.sh`:

  ./nengo-cl.sh LearnDigits.py

will run the experiment.

However, if you don't want to waste those CPU
cycles, you can download the results used
